// unit's OWN movement system one waypoint at a time via EnemyAI.ReceiveMoveOrder, advancing
// to the next only once EnemyAI reports the current leg is finished (HasActiveOrder == false).
//
// Because it goes through ReceiveMoveOrder, everything EnemyAI already does for orders comes
// for free: formation spacing between units on the same point, breaking off to fight enemies
// spotted en route, then resuming the path afterward. It also means this never fights EnemyAI
// for the NavMeshAgent/root motion - EnemyAI remains the single owner of movement.
